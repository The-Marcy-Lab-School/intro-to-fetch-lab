# Intro to Fetch Lab
 
 You will be creating a basic webpage that communicates with three APIs. You are responsible for creating the basic (but necessary) project files. 
 
 ## Feature 1: Star Wars API.
 
Somewhere on your webpage, you should make a button with the text `Get Opening Crawl` and a div with an id of `star-wars`. When the user clicks on the button, it will show the opening crawl to one of the Star Wars movies. You will be using the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/documentation).

You can make a request to `GET https://swapi.dev/api/films/1/`.
